###1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?###

I’ve been interest in programming since high school. During high school, I took an introductory HTML class and loved being able to create a website and see all the content come together by using HMTL tags. 

Although I went on to study business, I have always enjoyed working on computers. Eventually the mix between business and computers came together when I began administering Salesforce. The idea behind Salesforce is “clicks not code” for standard functionality, but there are many ways in which code is required to make actions happen. I try to use code to complement the platform and have been successful in creating a couple of triggers by doing a lot of research, testing and modifying code that others have written.  It is so exciting when I get something to work!

I have two developer certificates, but I obtained them answering questions from a text. Both certifications did not require me to have any programming experience or to write code. I would love to learn the skills necessary to make actions happen and understand the background of the applications I use every day. 

###2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?###

For the next two years, my goal is to become a Programmer. It is something I have wanted to do for a long time to fulfil my professional and personal goals. I plan to continue using tutorials from sites like <https://hourofcode.com/us> and other websites that provided educational material for self-learners, but I hope to attend ADA in February. 

If I am successful in learning Ruby, Rails, HTML + CSS, JavaScript and GIT + Source Control, over the next five years, I would like to continue programming and learning other computer languages and applications. Once I have a solid foundation, I think that I would like to move into consulting or work for an organization that is focused on creating software programs to help people work effortlessly and productively.   

###3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?###

A proverb we use in Colombia is: “No dar Papaya.” It means do not expose yourself to unnecessary risk. One time, I accidently left my purse in my car, and an hour later, the passenger window was broken and my purse stolen. I learned many lessons that night: 

1)	Listen to my mom – “Do not leave valuables visible.” It might sound cliché, but a mistake I frequently make is not listening to my mother. She is not always right, but she is quite often.

2)	How to file an insurance claim and a police report. 

3)	Good Samaritans exist – The police and the person who alerted me about my car were empathetic and helpful in a moment when I felt vulnerable and mistrusting. 

4)	Freeze my credit to prevent identity theft – When the police found my purse, it contained my passport card, credit cards, my state ID, and Social Security card. 

5)	Look at the bright side – Neither the car or anything else was stolen, and I was unharmed. 
After learning my lesson the hard way, I never leave anything visible in the car and pay close attention to my surroundings. 

###4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.###

Since I was little, I have enjoyed playing musical instruments, particularly the piano. One year, my mom bought me a light up keyboard for Christmas in which the keys light up to guide your fingers as to which keys to press to play a song. 

To learn a song, the keyboard lights up to show you the keys to press one hand at a time. I would play the same song for hours at a time with my right hand, and then, I would do the same with the left hand. Once I had memorized the keys for each hand, I was able to put everything together to play a melody. 

I leaned to play songs such as: “Pathétique Sonata (2nd Movement)”, “Moonlight Sonata”, “Canon in D,” and “Für Elise”.
